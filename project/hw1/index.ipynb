        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n",
        "\n",
        "The core hypothesis explored in the experiment is whether offering matching donations increases the likelihood and size of charitable contributions. Matching donations are often used by nonprofits under the belief that people are more likely to give when they know their donation will be \"matched\" by another funder.\n",
        "\n",
        "To test this idea, Karlan and List conducted a large-scale natural field experiment involving 50,083 individuals who had previously donated to a politically conservative nonprofit organization. These individuals were randomly assigned to receive fundraising letters with different conditions:\n",
        "- **Control group**: received a standard donation request.\n",
        "- **Treatment group**: received one of three types of matching grants — a 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1 match.\n",
        "- Each letter also varied the match threshold (i.e., how much the funder was willing to match in total) and the suggested donation amount (either equal to or a multiplier of the donor’s previous contribution).\n",
        "\n",
        "The strength of this design lies in its scale, natural setting (real donors, real money), and random assignment, which allows for clean causal inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project seeks to replicate their results.\n",

You'll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you'll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be \"noisey\" when only averaging a few numbers, but should \"settle down\" and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large.

To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms.
