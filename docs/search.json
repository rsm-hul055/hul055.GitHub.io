    "text": "Balance Check\nWe begin by checking whether the treatment and control groups are balanced in terms of observable characteristics. This is a common first step in analyzing randomized experiments: if randomization was implemented correctly, both groups should be similar on all baseline variables.\nHere, we focus on one such variable: the number of months since a donor’s last contribution (mrm2).\nThe average for the control group is 12.99 months, while for the treatment group it is 13.01 months. A t-test comparing these means yields t = 0.12, p = 0.905, indicating no statistically significant difference.\nWe also estimate a linear regression of mrm2 on the treatment indicator. The coefficient is effectively zero and not statistically significant, confirming the same conclusion.\nThese results suggest that the randomization was successful: the two groups appear well-balanced with respect to prior giving behavior. This gives us confidence that subsequent differences in donation outcomes can be attributed to the experimental treatments.\nimport pandas as pd from scipy import stats import statsmodels.api as sm\ndf = pd.read_stata(“karlan_list_2007.dta”)\ndf_subset = df[[“treatment”, “mrm2”]].dropna()\nmeans = df_subset.groupby(“treatment”)[“mrm2”].mean() print(means)\nt_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind( df_subset[df_subset[“treatment”] == 1][“mrm2”], df_subset[df_subset[“treatment”] == 0][“mrm2”], equal_var=False )\nX = sm.add_constant(df_subset[“treatment”]) model = sm.OLS(df_subset[“mrm2”], X).fit() model.summary()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy check for balance?\n\n\n\nBalance tests help confirm that the randomization worked as expected. If the treatment and control groups are similar on baseline characteristics, we can be more confident that later differences in donation outcomes are due to the treatment and not underlying differences between groups."

You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be “noisey” when only averaging a few numbers, but should “settle down” and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms.

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made (you can do this as a bivariate linear regression if you want). It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A. Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or something that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control.\nNOTE: Linear regression results appear replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper. Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions…\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression.

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be “noisey” when only averaging a few numbers, but should “settle down” and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader."

    "text": "Charitable Contribution Made\nWe begin by comparing donation rates between the treatment and control groups. In the graph below, we see the proportion of individuals who gave any donation, split by whether they received a matching offer or not.\n```fxnofyne import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.bar([‘Control’, ‘Treatment’], [0.018, 0.022]) ax.set_ylabel(‘Donation Rate’) ax.set_title(‘Effect of Matching on Giving’) fig\nThe donation rate for the control group is approximately 1.8%, while for the treatment group it is 2.2%. This difference is statistically significant:\nA t-test yields t = 3.21, p = 0.0013, indicating that the observed difference is unlikely to be due to random chance.\nA linear probability model (OLS) confirms this result with a positive and significant coefficient on treatment:\n```fxnofyne ols_model.summary2().tables[1]\nTo further validate the result, we estimate a probit model of donation on treatment status. The probit coefficient is 0.087 (p = 0.0019), again confirming a statistically significant effect of matching offers.\n```fxnofyne probit_model.summary2().tables[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\n\nThese results suggest that offering a matching donation significantly increases the likelihood that a person will donate. From a behavioral standpoint, this provides evidence that people are more motivated to give when they feel their contribution will be amplified.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression.
